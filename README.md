# What is THIS?

A Pythonic implementation of the famous A* algorithm.

# Why ANOTHER implementation

Because coding is awesome! Also because I really dislike the mess that the usual implementations creates. The A* algorithm is simple and beautiful and so must be its implementation.

# How is THIS diferent?

This is different because I refactored all the logic in propositional layers. This is achieved grouping together the parts of the algorithm that has the same level of abstraction, exposing the pure logic of A* in its higher layer.

# How can it be TESTED?

It comes with a `test.py` snippet to test the algorithm in a simple weighted maze.

# Can you EXPLAIN the algorithm?
